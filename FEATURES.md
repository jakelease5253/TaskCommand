# TaskCommand Feature List

A living document to track features, improvements, and changes we want to implement.

**Strategic Direction:** Microsoft Planner backend with modern UI and Slack integration for internal company-wide use at FieldWorks.

## üéØ High Priority

### In Progress
- [ ] **Sync checklist item state with Planner in real time**
  - Toggle handling in Focus Mode is optimistic and wired to call Planner
  - ETag concurrency handling in place (412 ‚Üí refetch + reconcile)
  - **Next:** confirm backend endpoint or `taskManager.updateChecklistItem` is active in DEV

- [ ] **Slack Integration (Phase 1 ‚Äî via Power Automate)**
  - **Basic Reminders**
    - Daily upcoming tasks at beginning of day
    - Daily kudos of completed & focused tasks
    - New assignment notifications
  - Scaffolding + routes created; Settings stub ready to hold the PA URL
  - **Next:** add `VITE_SLACK_FLOW_URL` in DEV only, wire Settings ‚Üí PA flow call

- [ ] **Manager & Admin Dashboards (MVP scaffolding)**
  - Routes in place: `/manager`, `/admin` with real site header
  - **Next:** Graph queries for ‚Äúopen tasks across plans‚Äù (direct reports / all company)

### Ready to Pick Up Next
- [ ] **Checklist reorder ‚Üí persist to Planner**
  - UI drag‚Äìdrop works and updates local state
  - **Next:** implement backend/API to compute and PATCH `orderHint` + return new ETag

- [ ] **Settings (Foundational)**
  - Slack preferences (enable/disable, times, channel/DM)
  - Admin visibility controls (or leverage Entra manager hierarchy)
  - Super Admin can enable All Company Dashboard visibility

## üìù Notes

### Strategic Considerations
- **Primary users:** FieldWorks employees  
- **Backend:** Microsoft Planner  
- **Auth:** Entra ID (SSO)  
- **Deployment:** Azure Static Web App  
- **Integration focus:** Slack

### Technical Considerations
- Feature-based folders to avoid single-file bloat  
- Typed API client for Graph + Slack (retry, ETag, rate limiting)  
- Centralized state (Zustand/RTK) with normalized task entities  
- Route-based code splitting (dashboards, reports)  
- RBAC guard components + server-side checks  
- Virtualized task lists for large datasets  
- Background sync & cache (IndexedDB) for PWA resilience
