## ‚úÖ Completed

### 2025-10
- [x] Initial feature list created (2025-10-20)
- [x] Microsoft Planner API integration with authentication
- [x] Azure Static Web App deployment
- [x] Basic task display and management

## üìù Notes

### Strategic Considerations
- **Primary users:** FieldWorks employees company-wide
- **Backend:** Microsoft Planner (no data migration needed)
- **Authentication:** Azure AD/Entra (SSO with existing work accounts)
- **Deployment:** Azure Static Web App (already configured)
- **Integration focus:** Slack (company uses Slack, not Teams)

### Technical Considerations
- Focus mode checklist features are top priority for immediate implementation
- Manager interface will leverage existing Graph API permissions
- All permissions already granted - ready to implement features
- ETag-based concurrency control required for Planner updates
- Consider rate limiting for bulk operations
- Adopt modular architecture to avoid single-file bloat: feature-based folders (`features/focus`, `features/slack`, `features/dashboards`)
- Introduce a typed API client layer for Graph + Slack (with retry, ETag handling, and rate limiting)
- Centralized state management (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit) with normalized task entities
- Route-based code splitting via React Router; lazy load dashboards and reports
- RBAC guard components and server-side checks where applicable
- Virtualized task lists for large datasets (e.g., react-window)
- Background sync & cache (IndexedDB) for resilience and mobile/PWA readiness
