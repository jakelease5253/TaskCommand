### ADHD-Focused UI/UX Analysis

**Project Mission:** Create an interface that supports focus and minimizes distractions for users with ADHD.

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01 (after Main Page Redesign & Planning Interface)

#### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Pagination (All Tasks)** ✅ *Implemented 2025-11-01*
   - Limits overwhelm by showing only 10 tasks at a time
   - Forces focus on a manageable subset
   - Clear navigation with page numbers
   - **Impact:** Prevents the paralysis of seeing 50+ tasks at once
   - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx`

2. **Full-Width Priority Queue** ✅ *Implemented 2025-11-01*
   - Prominent placement at top of page
   - Clear visual hierarchy: "Start here, then look below"
   - Numbered slots (1-7) create clear prioritization
   - **Impact:** Makes the most important tasks impossible to miss
   - Files: `src/App.jsx:1022-1082`

3. **Planning Interface Separation** ✅ *Implemented 2025-11-01*
   - Dedicated space for decision-making separate from execution
   - Two-column layout separates browsing (left) from deciding (right)
   - Can see all tasks at once to make informed choices
   - **Impact:** Separates "planning mode" from "doing mode" - reduces context switching
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx`

4. **Compact Card Design** ✅ *Implemented 2025-11-01*
   - 30-40% reduction in card height
   - Single-line metadata reduces visual noise
   - Consistent styling creates predictable patterns
   - **Impact:** More scannable, less overwhelming, easier to process visually
   - Files: `src/components/tasks/PriorityQueue.jsx`, `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx`

5. **Visual State Indicators**
   - Tasks in queue appear dimmed in Planning view (prevents adding duplicates)
   - Focus task has blue ring
   - Overdue tasks have red highlighting
   - **Impact:** Instant visual feedback reduces cognitive load

6. **Drag-and-Drop Interaction**
   - Tactile, immediate feedback
   - Clear drag preview showing just task title
   - Visual drop zones in Planning queue
   - **Impact:** Kinesthetic interaction helps with engagement and decision-making

7. **Progressive Disclosure (Hover Tooltips)** ✅ *Implemented 2025-11-01*
   - Full task details only appear when needed
   - Keeps main interface clean
   - 1-second delay prevents accidental triggers
   - **Impact:** Information available on demand without cluttering the view
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:395-525`

8. **Smart Date Filtering** ✅ *Enhanced 2025-11-07 with Multi-Select*
   - Multi-select date range filtering (All, Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, This Week, Next Week, Backlogged)
   - Custom date range for specific planning needs
   - Checkbox-based UI allows selecting multiple date ranges simultaneously
   - **Impact:** Powerful filtering capability to narrow overwhelming task list quickly with flexible combinations
   - Files: `src/components/tasks/DateRangeMultiSelect.jsx`, `src/utils/dateFilters.js`

9. **Focus Task Card**
   - Single task prominence at the top is excellent for attention management
   - Reduces decision paralysis by highlighting one task

10. **Priority Queue Limited to 7**
    - Constraint prevents overwhelm
    - Matches working memory limits (~7 items)
    - Enforced limit creates helpful boundaries

11. **One-Click Complete**
    - Immediate dopamine hit
    - No confirmation friction
    - Fast feedback loop encourages completion

12. **Collapse Functionality**
    - Can hide "All Tasks" noise
    - Reduces visual overwhelm
    - User controls information density

#### ⚠️ What's Still Challenging

1. **Filter Complexity - Main Page**
   - **Issue:** FilterBar still has multiple dropdowns, search, sort options
   - **ADHD Impact:** Too many choices at once can cause decision paralysis
   - **Severity:** Medium - users might avoid filtering entirely
   - **Recommendation:** Collapse by default or use progressive disclosure
   - Files: `src/components/tasks/FilterBar.jsx`

2. **Planning Page Filter Overload** 🔥 *High Priority*
   - **Issue:** 4 dropdowns (Sort, Date, Priority, Plan) + search bar + custom date inputs
   - **ADHD Impact:** The planning interface meant to reduce overwhelm has 6+ decision points before seeing tasks
   - **Severity:** High - contradicts purpose of dedicated planning space
   - **Recommendation:** Use tabs/presets instead of all filters visible at once
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:247-350`

3. **No Visual Progress Indicators** 🔥 *High Priority*
   - **Issue:** Can't see "X% complete" or "5 of 20 tasks done today"
   - **ADHD Impact:** Missing dopamine hit of visible progress; hard to build momentum
   - **Severity:** High - progress visibility is crucial for ADHD motivation
   - **Recommendation:** Add daily completion counter and progress ring

4. **Custom Date Range Persistence**
   - **Issue:** When "Custom Range" is selected, the date pickers stay visible taking up space
   - **ADHD Impact:** Visual clutter persists even after dates are set
   - **Severity:** Low - minor annoyance
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:328-350`

5. **Alert Dialogs for Errors**
   - **Issue:** JavaScript `alert()` and `confirm()` used for queue full, clear all
   - **ADHD Impact:** Jarring interruption breaks flow state
   - **Severity:** Medium - could use inline warnings instead
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:201, 228`

6. **No "Done Planning" Flow**
   - **Issue:** Planning page has no clear completion state or transition back to main page
   - **ADHD Impact:** Unclear when task is complete; might keep tweaking forever
   - **Severity:** Medium - lacks closure/completion signal
   - **Recommendation:** Add "Save & Return to Tasks" button

7. **Arbitrary 7-Task Limit (No Context)**
   - **Issue:** Queue limited to 7 with no explanation visible to user
   - **ADHD Impact:** Might feel frustrating or arbitrary without context about why
   - **Severity:** Low - minor UX polish
   - **Recommendation:** Add tooltip explaining the cognitive science behind 7±2 rule

8. **Fixed Scroll Height**
   - **Issue:** Task pool has `maxHeight: 600px` regardless of screen size
   - **ADHD Impact:** On smaller screens wastes space; on larger screens underutilizes available area
   - **Severity:** Low - functional but not optimal
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:354`

9. **Tooltip Position Always Center Screen**
   - **Issue:** Hover tooltip appears dead center, might cover the task being examined
   - **ADHD Impact:** Eye needs to jump to center of screen, losing place in list
   - **Severity:** Medium - breaks visual continuity
   - **Recommendation:** Position near cursor or task being hovered
   - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:460-467`

10. **No Keyboard Navigation**
    - **Issue:** All interactions require mouse (drag, click, hover)
    - **ADHD Impact:** Some users focus better with keyboard shortcuts; no alternative input method
    - **Severity:** Medium - accessibility and preference issue
    - **Recommendation:** Add shortcuts (Space=focus, Enter=edit, C=complete, arrows=navigate)

11. **Empty State Lacks Guidance**
    - **Issue:** When priority queue is empty in Planning, just shows 7 empty drop zones
    - **ADHD Impact:** No prompting or guidance to get started
    - **Severity:** Low - obvious what to do but could be friendlier
    - Files: `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx:608-614`

12. **No Quick Add to Queue**
    - **Issue:** Must drag tasks to queue; no right-click or button option
    - **ADHD Impact:** Dragging requires fine motor control and feels "heavy" for quick decisions
    - **Severity:** Medium - could use a "+" button on hover for one-click add
    - **Recommendation:** Add quick-add button on task rows

13. **Multi-Select Checkboxes Always Visible**
    - **Issue:** Adds visual noise to every task
    - **ADHD Impact:** Only needed occasionally but always present
    - **Severity:** Medium - should be hidden behind a "Select Multiple" mode toggle
    - Files: `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx:142-149`

14. **Toast Notifications Disappear**
    - **Issue:** Important feedback vanishes in 3-5 seconds
    - **ADHD Impact:** Easy to miss if attention wanders
    - **Severity:** Low - no persistent notification area

## 🐛 Known Issues / Bug Fixes

### UI/UX Issues
- [x] **Refresh button position inconsistent** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-06*
  - **Issue:** Refresh button moved around depending on which page was active
  - **Fix:** Consistent positioning across all views
  - **File:** `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`

- [x] **Goal setting page displaying as UTC on cards** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-06*
  - **Issue:** Time displays on goal cards were showing in UTC instead of user's local timezone
  - **Fix:** Added work hour time display to Planning page weekly summary cards with proper 12-hour formatting
  - **Implementation:** Times now display in user-friendly 12-hour format (e.g., "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM") on each day card
  - **File:** `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx` (lines 395-415)

- [x] **Slack logo on settings page looks bad** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-06*
  - **Issue:** Slack logo used monochrome styling instead of official brand colors
  - **Fix:** Replaced with official Slack logo featuring brand colors (red, cyan, green, yellow)
  - **Implementation:** Updated SVG icon and removed color overrides to display official branding
  - **Files:** `src/components/ui/icons.jsx` (lines 279-294), `src/features/settings/Settings.jsx` (lines 1052-1062)

- [x] **Replace browser dropdowns with custom styled dropdowns** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-06*
  - **Issue:** Many dropdowns used browser's native select element causing inconsistent UI styling
  - **Fix:** Created reusable custom dropdown component and replaced all native selects throughout app
  - **Implementation:** Theme dropdown, Priority, Plan, Bucket, Assignee, Status, and filter dropdowns now use custom styling
  - **Files:** `src/components/tasks/FilterBar.jsx`, `src/components/tasks/NewTaskModal.jsx`, `src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.jsx`, `src/features/dashboards/manager/ManagerDashboard.jsx`

- [x] **After bulk action, tasks are remaining selected** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-07*
  - **Issue:** After performing bulk operations (date change, move, assignee), task checkboxes remain selected
  - **Fix:** Changed all bulk operations to clear ALL selections instead of only removing successful tasks
  - **Implementation:**
    - App.jsx: Replaced partial selection clearing with `setSelectedTaskIds(new Set())` in all 5 bulk handlers
    - Planning Page: Added `handleClearSelection()` calls after all bulk operations (complete, priority) and modal closures (assignee, move, dueDate)
  - **Files:**
    - `src/App.jsx` (lines 670, 721, 785, 854, 911)
    - `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx` (lines 1330-1337, 1344-1371)

- [ ] **Focus Task Reminder alert not capturing focus on the tab**
  - **Issue:** When focus timer reminder alert appears, it doesn't automatically bring the TaskCommand tab to focus
  - **Expected:** Alert should capture user attention by bringing tab to foreground or showing prominent browser notification
  - **Current Behavior:** Alert dialog appears but tab may remain in background
  - **Potential Solutions:** Use browser Notification API with permission request, or implement more prominent in-app modal that auto-focuses
  - **Files:** Focus timer component (needs investigation)

- [ ] **Remove New Task and Refresh buttons from Manager Dashboard**
  - **Issue:** Manager Dashboard has "New Task" and "Refresh" buttons in the header that may not be necessary or could be relocated
  - **Current Behavior:** Buttons appear in dashboard header alongside other controls
  - **Consideration:** Determine if these actions should be accessible from Manager Dashboard or if they clutter the interface
  - **Files:** Manager Dashboard component header section

- [ ] **Manager Dashboard title too close to header**
  - **Issue:** "Manager Dashboard" title has insufficient spacing from the header bar
  - **Current Behavior:** Title appears cramped against header with minimal margin
  - **Expected:** Better visual spacing between header and page title
  - **Fix:** Add appropriate margin-top to dashboard title
  - **Files:** `src/features/dashboards/manager/ManagerDashboard.jsx`

- [ ] **Post Comment button stays gray until hover**
  - **Issue:** "Post Comment" button on Edit Task Modal remains gray (disabled appearance) until mouse hovers over it
  - **Current Behavior:** Button doesn't visually indicate it's enabled when text is typed in comment box
  - **Expected:** Button should change to primary theme color immediately when comment box has content
  - **Fix:** Update button styling to reflect enabled state based on comment text, not hover state
  - **Files:** `src/components/tasks/TaskComments.jsx`


### Slack Integration - Under Monitoring
- [ ] **Slack Morning Digest not sending consistently**
  - **Status:** Not working reliably in production
  - **Issue:** Digest not being sent as expected
  - **Local Testing:** Timer triggers don't fire automatically in local Azure Functions dev
  - **Test Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:7071/api/test/morning-digest` with `{"azureUserId": "your-id"}`
  - **Production:** Should fire daily at 8:00 AM (`0 0 8 * * *`)
  - **Action:** Monitor in production to ensure reliability
  - **Known Technical Issues:**
    1. **Timezone Problem:** Timer fires at 8 AM UTC for all users (not local time)
    2. **No Retry Mechanism:** Failed API calls are only logged, no retry for transient failures
    3. **Token Expiration:** No token refresh logic for expired Slack tokens
    4. **Silent Failures:** Errors only logged to console, no alerting/monitoring
    5. **Rate Limiting:** Sequential calls to `graphClient.getUserTasks()` could hit Microsoft Graph rate limits with many users
  - **Files:** `backend/index.js:1077-1090`, `backend/services/morningDigestService.js`

- [ ] **Slack Assignment Notifications not sending consistently**
  - **Status:** Not working reliably in production
  - **Issue:** Assignment notifications not being sent as expected
  - **Local Testing:** Timer triggers don't fire automatically in local Azure Functions dev
  - **Test Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:7071/api/test/assignment-check` with `{"azureUserId": "your-id"}`
  - **Production:** Should fire every 10 minutes (`0 */10 * * * *`)
  - **Action:** Monitor in production to ensure consistent delivery

- [ ] **Slack digest time setting does not work**
  - **Issue:** User-configurable digest delivery time setting in Settings page doesn't affect actual delivery
  - **Current Behavior:** Morning digest always sends at 8 AM (hardcoded in timer function)
  - **Expected:** Should respect user's selected time preference
  - **Needs:** Timezone support implementation, dynamic cron schedule generation
  - **Files:** `src/features/settings/Settings.jsx`, `backend/functions/SendMorningDigest.js`

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Code Quality

### 🚨 CRITICAL - Security & Architecture (Must Fix Before Production)

#### Security Issues
- [ ] **Manager Authorization Not Implemented** - `backend/utils/auth.js:45-72`
  - **Issue:** `checkManagerAuthorization()` returns `true` for ALL authenticated users
  - **Impact:** Anyone with Azure AD login can access Manager Dashboard and see ALL company tasks
  - **Fix:** Implement actual Azure AD group membership check
  - **File:** `backend/utils/auth.js`

- [ ] **OAuth Tokens Stored in localStorage** - `src/hooks/useAuth.js:56-57`
  - **Issue:** Tokens vulnerable to XSS attacks, no token refresh mechanism
  - **Impact:** Security vulnerability, tokens persist indefinitely
  - **Fix:** Move to httpOnly, Secure cookies with token refresh flow
  - **File:** `src/hooks/useAuth.js`

- [ ] **Hardcoded Credentials in Version Control** - `.env.local`
  - **Issue:** Client IDs and tenant IDs committed to git
  - **Impact:** Credentials exposed in repository
  - **Fix:** Remove from git tracking, rotate credentials, use CI/CD secrets
  - **Command:** `git rm --cached .env.local && git commit -m "Remove credentials"`

- [ ] **CORS Allows Wildcard by Default** - `backend/index.js` (multiple locations)
  - **Issue:** `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS || '*'`
  - **Impact:** Any domain can call the API if env var not set
  - **Fix:** Remove wildcard default, fail secure, validate origins explicitly
  - **Files:** Lines 802, 29, 149, etc. in `backend/index.js`

- [ ] **Encryption Key Hardcoded Default** - `backend/services/storageService.js:17-18`
  - **Issue:** Falls back to `'development-key-32-characters!!'` if env var not set
  - **Impact:** Weak encryption in production if misconfigured
  - **Fix:** Use Azure Key Vault, validate key is set, fail if not configured
  - **File:** `backend/services/storageService.js`

#### Architecture Issues
- [ ] **N+1 Query Problem in Manager Dashboard** - `backend/services/graphClient.js:36-127`
  - **Issue:** `getAllCompanyTasks()` makes exponential API calls (50 groups × 10 plans = 500+ calls)
  - **Impact:** Performance degrades exponentially with organization size
  - **Fix:** Use Microsoft Graph batch API, implement caching with TTL
  - **File:** `backend/services/graphClient.js`

- [ ] **No Pagination Implemented** - `backend/services/graphClient.js:43-70`
  - **Issue:** No `$top` or `$skip` parameters on Graph API calls
  - **Impact:** Missing data if org has >20 groups/plans
  - **Fix:** Implement pagination with Graph API parameters
  - **File:** `backend/services/graphClient.js`

### ⚠️ HIGH Priority - Code Quality & Maintainability

#### Component Architecture
- [ ] **App.jsx Too Large** - `src/App.jsx` (738 lines)
  - **Issue:** 23+ useState calls, 8+ useEffect hooks, all app state in one component
  - **Impact:** Hard to maintain, unnecessary re-renders, poor performance
  - **Fix:** Extract state to Context API or state management library (Zustand/Redux)
  - **Action Items:**
    - Create TaskContext for task state management
    - Create FocusContext for focus mode state
    - Create UIContext for UI preferences (filters, collapsed state)
    - Extract localStorage logic to `useLocalStorage` custom hook
    - Break down into smaller feature components

- [ ] **Backend index.js Monolithic** - `backend/index.js` (1,356 lines)
  - **Issue:** All Azure Function endpoints in one file
  - **Impact:** Hard to navigate, duplicated code, merge conflicts
  - **Fix:** Split into separate files per endpoint
  - **Structure:**
    ```
    backend/
      functions/
        tasks/
          getCompanyTasks.js
          completeTask.js
          reopenTask.js
        slack/
          oauthCallback.js
          commands.js
          interactions.js
        test/
          morningDigest.js
      index.js (imports and registers all functions)
    ```

#### Code Duplication
- [ ] **Duplicated CORS Headers** - `backend/index.js` (~15 instances)
  - **Issue:** Same CORS header object defined in every endpoint
  - **Fix:** Create `backend/middleware/cors.js` utility
  - **Impact:** Maintenance burden, inconsistency risk

- [ ] **Duplicated Token Validation** - `backend/index.js` (~5 instances)
  - **Issue:** Same auth validation code in every protected endpoint
  - **Fix:** Create reusable auth wrapper/middleware function
  - **Files:** Lines 45-78 (GetCompanyTasks), 165-198 (CompleteTask), etc.

- [ ] **81 Direct fetch() Calls** - Multiple files
  - **Issue:** No centralized API client, repeated Authorization header creation
  - **Fix:** Create `src/api/client.js` with auth headers built-in
  - **Files Affected:**
    - `src/hooks/useTasks.js`
    - `src/components/tasks/NewTaskModal.jsx`
    - `src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.jsx`
    - `src/features/dashboards/manager/ManagerDashboard.jsx`
  - **Note:** `src/services/graphAPI.js` exists but is unused (44 lines of dead code)

- [ ] **Unused GraphApiService Class** - `src/services/graphAPI.js:1-44`
  - **Issue:** Class is defined but never imported or used
  - **Fix:** Either remove OR refactor codebase to use it consistently
  - **Decision Needed:** Delete or adopt?

#### Error Handling
- [ ] **Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns**
  - **Issue:** Mix of `console.error()` + early return, `throw error`, silent catches
  - **Impact:** Unpredictable error behavior, debugging difficulty
  - **Fix:** Standardize error handling pattern across codebase
  - **Pattern to adopt:**
    - Services: throw errors with context
    - Components: catch and show user-friendly messages
    - Backend: return consistent error response structure

- [ ] **No Centralized Error Handling** - Backend
  - **Issue:** Each endpoint handles errors differently
  - **Fix:** Create `backend/middleware/errorHandler.js`
  - **Benefit:** Consistent error responses, better logging

- [ ] **Missing Error Boundaries** - Frontend
  - **Issue:** Single component error crashes entire app
  - **Fix:** Create `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` and wrap major sections
  - **Wrap:** App root, ManagerDashboard, PersonalDashboard, FocusMode

- [ ] **No Response.ok Checking** - `src/services/graphAPI.js:10-29`
  - **Issue:** Calls `.json()` without checking if response succeeded
  - **Fix:** Add `if (!response.ok) throw new Error(...)` before parsing

#### Security - Additional
- [ ] **No Rate Limiting** - All backend endpoints
  - **Issue:** Vulnerable to brute force and resource exhaustion
  - **Fix:** Implement rate limiting middleware
  - **Library:** express-rate-limit or Azure API Management

- [ ] **No Input Validation** - Multiple endpoints
  - **Issue:** Request data accepted without validation
  - **Fix:** Add validation library (Joi or Zod)
  - **Example:** `src/components/tasks/NewTaskModal.jsx:75` - parseInt without validation

- [ ] **Potential XSS through Task Descriptions**
  - **Issue:** Task descriptions may contain HTML/scripts
  - **Fix:** Sanitize user-generated content with DOMPurify
  - **Files:** All components that display task.description

### 📊 MEDIUM Priority - Performance & Best Practices

#### React Performance
- [ ] **Missing Performance Optimizations**
  - **Issue:** Only 7 uses of React.memo/useCallback/useMemo across entire frontend
  - **Impact:** Unnecessary re-renders, slower UI
  - **Fix Locations:**
    - `src/App.jsx:623-645` - Wrap event handlers with useCallback
    - TaskCard components - Wrap with React.memo
    - Computed values (filteredTasks, priorityTasks) - Use useMemo
    - AllTasksList and PriorityQueue - Receive memoized callbacks

- [ ] **localStorage Operations on Every Change** - `src/App.jsx:74-79`
  - **Issue:** Serialization and storage on every taskFocusTimes change (every second during timer)
  - **Impact:** Blocks UI thread, excessive I/O
  - **Fix:** Debounce localStorage writes, batch updates

- [ ] **No Virtual Scrolling for Large Task Lists** - `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx`
  - **Issue:** Renders all 100+ tasks in DOM
  - **Impact:** Memory overhead, slow scrolling, poor mobile performance
  - **Fix:** Implement react-window or react-virtualized
  - **Note:** ManagerDashboard already uses virtual scrolling

#### Configuration & Dependencies
- [ ] **Missing Frontend Dependencies**
  - **Issue:** No HTTP client, state management, validation, or testing libraries
  - **Recommendations:**
    - HTTP Client: axios or ky
    - State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
    - Validation: Zod or Yup
    - Testing: Vitest or Jest + React Testing Library
    - Error Tracking: Sentry or LogRocket

- [ ] **Missing Backend Dependencies**
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Validation: joi or zod
    - Logging: winston
    - Rate Limiting: express-rate-limit
    - Environment Validation: dotenv-safe

- [ ] **No Type Safety**
  - **Issue:** TypeScript types available but not enforced
  - **Fix:** Enable TypeScript strict mode OR enforce JSDoc type checking
  - **Benefit:** Catch errors at build time

#### Code Organization
- [ ] **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**
  - **Issue:** Mix of camelCase (graphAPI.js) and kebab-case file names
  - **Fix:** Standardize on kebab-case for files, camelCase for exports

- [ ] **Missing JSDoc Comments**
  - **Issue:** Complex functions lack documentation
  - **Examples:** `src/App.jsx:234` (filterAndSortTasks), many functions in storageService.js
  - **Fix:** Add JSDoc to all exported functions

- [ ] **Debug Files in Production Repo**
  - **Files to Delete:**
    - `backend/test-get-user-id.js`
    - `backend/debug-slack-token.js`
    - `backend/reset-check-time.js`
  - **Fix:** Move to dedicated test directory or delete

- [ ] **Excessive console.log Statements** - 114 across 13 backend files
  - **Issue:** Excessive logging impacts production performance
  - **Fix:** Replace with structured logging (Winston) with log levels

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] **No Offline Support / Service Worker**
  - **Issue:** No offline capability, all data lost on disconnect
  - **Fix:** Implement Service Worker for offline support
  - **Benefit:** Better mobile experience, PWA capability

- [ ] **No Testing Framework**
  - **Issue:** No automated tests
  - **Fix:** Add Vitest + React Testing Library
  - **Priority Tests:**
    - Auth flow
    - Task CRUD operations
    - Manager dashboard filtering
    - Focus mode timer

#### Manager Dashboard Bug Fixes (2025-10-31)

- [x] **Status Filter Errors Fixed** (2000+ console errors)
  - **Issue:** JavaScript hoisting error - `getTaskStatus` function called before declaration
  - **Issue:** Console.log mapping over 1000+ tasks on every status filter click
  - **Fix:** Moved helper functions before usage, removed debug console.logs
  - **Result:** Status filters now work smoothly without errors

- [x] **Completed Tasks Showing by Default**
  - **Issue:** Manager Dashboard started with all tasks including completed
  - **Fix:** Changed `filteredAndSortedTasks` to start with `incompleteTasks` only
  - **Result:** Dashboard now shows only incomplete tasks by default, "completed" status filter works to show finished tasks

- [x] **useMemo Dependency Array Fix**
  - **Issue:** Missing `customStartDate` and `customEndDate` from dependencies
  - **Fix:** Added missing dependencies to `filteredAndSortedTasks` useMemo
  - **Result:** Custom date range filter now updates properly when dates change

- [x] **Filters Persist Between Reloads**
  - **Status:** Previously implemented (localStorage)

- [x] **Checklist Completion Errors Fixed**
  - **Status:** Previously fixed in earlier update

- [x] **Duplicate Refresh Buttons Resolved**
  - **Status:** UX improved (may receive additional UI updates in future)

- [x] **Task Description Error Fixed**
  - **Issue:** Error when adding/editing description field in task modals
  - **Status:** Resolved alongside checklist fixes in earlier update
  - **Result:** Task descriptions now save successfully from all modals

- [x] **Task Completion Optimistic Updates** (2025-10-31)
  - **Issue:** Task completion triggered full list refresh, losing scroll position and feeling janky
  - **Cause:** `fetchAllTasks()` called after every task completion in App.jsx
  - **Fix:** Implemented true optimistic updates:
    1. Task removed from list immediately when checkbox clicked (instant feedback)
    2. API call happens in background
    3. If API fails, task is restored to list with error message
    4. Removed unnecessary `fetchAllTasks()` call (only refetch on error)
  - **Result:** Smooth, instant task completion without scroll position loss

- [x] **Task Editing Optimistic Updates** (2025-10-31)
  - **Issue:** Editing a task (changing date, title, priority, etc.) triggered full list refresh
  - **Cause:** `fetchAllTasks()` called after every task edit in App.jsx onTaskUpdated callback
  - **Fix:** Implemented optimistic updates for task editing:
    1. Modified EditTaskModal to pass updated task data back through onTaskUpdated callback
    2. App.jsx now optimistically updates the single task in the tasks array (using `setTasks`)
    3. Exported `setTasks` from useTasks hook for direct state updates
    4. No full refresh needed - only the edited task is updated in place
    5. If editing focused task, updates focus task state immediately
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.jsx` (lines 207-225)
    - `src/App.jsx` (lines 737-754)
    - `src/hooks/useTasks.js` (line 226 - exported setTasks)
  - **Result:** Instant task updates without losing scroll position or triggering full page refresh

- [x] **Page Refresh Navigation Persistence** (2025-10-31)
  - **Issue:** Refreshing the page always returns to Personal Tasks view, losing context
  - **Impact:** Users on Manager Dashboard or Settings lose their place on refresh
  - **Fix:** Implemented localStorage persistence for current view:
    1. Updated `currentView` useState initialization to read from localStorage (lazy initializer function)
    2. Added useEffect to save `currentView` to localStorage whenever it changes
    3. Key: `taskcommand_current_view`, values: 'personal', 'manager', 'settings'
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/App.jsx` (lines 41-45: lazy state initialization, lines 91-94: save useEffect)
  - **Result:** Page now remembers which view you were on across refreshes

- [x] **Unassigned Tasks Filter** (2025-10-31)
  - **Issue:** No way to filter for tasks with no assignee in Manager Dashboard
  - **Impact:** Cannot easily identify tasks needing assignment
  - **Fix:** Added "Unassigned" filter option:
    1. Added "Unassigned" option to assignee dropdown (special ID: `__unassigned__`)
    2. Updated filtering logic to handle unassigned case (no assignments or empty assignments object)
    3. Updated filter chip display to show "Unassigned" instead of the special ID
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/features/dashboards/manager/ManagerDashboard.jsx` (lines 713, 220-232, 762)
  - **Result:** Managers can now easily filter to see all unassigned tasks with one click

- [x] **Manager Dashboard Virtual Scrolling Fixed** (2025-10-31)
  - **Issue:** Could only see first ~20 tasks, couldn't scroll to see more even though they existed
  - **Cause:** Virtual scrolling implementation was missing spacer rows to create scrollable area
  - **Fix:** Added spacer rows above and below visible tasks:
    1. Top spacer: Height = (rows above viewport) × ROW_HEIGHT
    2. Bottom spacer: Height = (rows below viewport) × ROW_HEIGHT
    3. This makes tbody the correct total height so scrolling works properly
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/features/dashboards/manager/ManagerDashboard.jsx` (lines 871-876 top spacer, 930-940 bottom spacer)
  - **Result:** Can now scroll through all filtered tasks (hundreds or thousands) smoothly with only 20 rendered at a time

#### Main Page Redesign & Planning Interface (2025-11-01)

- [x] **Planning Interface** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*
  - **Purpose:** Dedicated interface for building priority queue with full task visibility
  - **Features:**
    - Two-column layout: 60% task pool (left), 40% priority queue builder (right)
    - Compact single-line task rows in pool showing Title, Due Date, Priority
    - Search bar filters by task title in real-time
    - Advanced filtering: Sort (due date/priority/plan/title), Date filter, Priority, Plan
    - Custom date range with From/To date pickers
    - Hover tooltips show full task details (description, checklist, assignees) after 1 second
    - Drag-and-drop from task pool to numbered slots (1-7) in priority queue
    - Visual feedback: dimmed tasks already in queue, clean drag preview showing task title
    - Tasks in queue appear washed out in list but tooltip shows at full opacity
    - Loading spinner matching other pages
  - **Navigation:** Calendar icon in header menu
  - **Files Created:**
    - `src/features/planning/PlanningView.jsx` (485 lines)
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` (added Planning menu item)
    - `src/components/ui/icons.jsx` (added CheckSquare icon)
    - `src/App.jsx` (integrated Planning view, handler for queue updates)
  - **Result:** Users can see all tasks at once to make informed priority decisions, then drag to build queue

- [x] **Personal Tasks Layout Redesign** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*
  - **Change:** Stacked vertical layout (was two-column grid with sidebar)
  - **New Layout:**
    - Priority Queue: Full-width at top
    - All Tasks: Full-width below Priority Queue
  - **Benefits:**
    - More prominent priority queue (better focus)
    - Better use of horizontal space on wide screens
    - Clearer visual hierarchy from priority to all tasks
    - Less cramped feeling than sidebar layout
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/App.jsx:1022-1082` (layout structure)
    - `src/components/tasks/PriorityQueue.jsx:74` (updated empty state text from "left" to "below")
  - **Result:** Cleaner, more focused layout supporting ADHD-friendly design principles

- [x] **All Tasks Pagination** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*
  - **Feature:** Limit All Tasks display to 10 tasks per page
  - **Implementation:**
    - Added `currentPage` and `tasksPerPage` state
    - Calculate paginated slice of filtered tasks
    - Pagination controls with Previous/Next buttons
    - Smart page number display (first, last, current, adjacent pages with ellipsis)
    - "Showing X-Y of Z tasks" counter
    - Auto-reset to page 1 when filters or sorting changes
    - Controls only appear when multiple pages exist
  - **Benefits:**
    - Reduces information overwhelm (ADHD-focused)
    - Cleaner interface with less scrolling
    - Forces focus on smaller subset of tasks
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/App.jsx` (pagination state and calculation)
    - `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx` (pagination UI)
  - **Result:** Users see 10 tasks at a time instead of overwhelming list of all tasks

- [x] **Consistent Card Styling** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*
  - **Change:** Matched text sizes and spacing between Priority Queue and All Tasks
  - **Standardization:**
    - Title: Changed from `h3 text-lg` to `h4` (same font size)
    - Metadata: All use `text-xs` (was `text-sm` in All Tasks)
    - Icons: All metadata icons `w-3 h-3`, button icons `w-4 h-4`
    - Spacing: Both use `gap-2` for metadata, `p-4` padding
    - Priority badges: Both use `py-0.5` padding
    - Container alignment: Both use `items-center`
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/tasks/AllTasksList.jsx` (text sizes, icon sizes, spacing)
  - **Result:** Visual consistency across all task cards creates cohesive interface

- [x] **Priority Queue Compact Layout** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*
  - **Change:** Reduced card height and reorganized metadata for full-width layout
  - **Improvements:**
    - Single line metadata: Due Date → Plan → Bucket → Assignees → Priority → Overdue
    - Horizontal button layout (was vertical stack)
    - Button order: Focus Toggle → Remove → Edit → Complete
    - Added Complete button (was missing)
    - Added assignees display with user profiles
    - Reduced title margin from `mb-2` to `mb-1.5`
  - **Benefits:**
    - Cards are 30-40% shorter (less vertical space)
    - All info visible at glance on one line
    - Better use of full-width layout
    - More compact and scannable
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/components/tasks/PriorityQueue.jsx` (layout, metadata order, buttons)
    - `src/App.jsx` (pass userProfiles prop)
  - **Result:** Compact, information-dense cards that work well in full-width layout

- [x] **All Tasks Compact Layout** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-01*

    - Chevron reverses direction (down when collapsed, up when expanded)
    - Only content (gray bar and metric cards) collapses/expands
    - Smooth inline collapse without layout shift
    - Component always renders, just hides content when collapsed
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/features/dashboards/personal/TodaysWins.jsx` - Added isCollapsed prop, conditional content rendering
    - `src/App.jsx:1254-1259` - Simplified to always render TodaysWins with isCollapsed state
  - **Result:** Clean collapse interaction that keeps UI stable and predictable

- [x] **Multi-Select Repositioning** ✅ *Completed 2025-11-06*
  - **Issue:** Multi-select checkboxes and bulk actions on main page contradicted "execution mode" design intent
  - **Reasoning:** Main page is for working on decided tasks, Planning page is for organizing and making decisions
  - **Changes:**
    - Removed multi-select checkboxes from All Tasks list on main page
    - Removed global BulkActionsBar from App.jsx
    - Added multi-select to Planning page with full bulk operations support

  - **Fix:** Added success message banner with auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
  - **Issue 2:** Error when trying to post first comment on a task (conversationThreadId required)
  - **Fix:** Backend now attempts to create conversation thread automatically
  - **Known Limitation:** Microsoft Graph API has read-only conversationThreadId, so first comment must still be created in Planner
  - **Features:**
    - Green success banner when comment posts successfully
    - Red error banner with helpful messages for failures
    - Auto-dismiss success messages after 3 seconds
  - **Files Modified:**

## 📝 Notes

### Design & Planning Considerations

#### Element Dictionary (Terminology Standardization)
Need to establish consistent terminology across codebase and documentation:
- **Personal Task List** - The full list of tasks shown on the Personal (Main) Page
- **Company Task List** - List of tasks shown on the Manager Dashboard
- **Priority Queue** - Top 7 high-priority tasks with drag-and-drop ordering
- **Focused Task** - Currently active task in Focus Mode
- **Performance Dashboard** - Metrics and analytics view (needs definition)

#### Performance Dashboard - Open Questions
- What metrics should we track?
  - Task completion rate?
  - Focus time per day/week?
  - Streak tracking?
  - Tasks completed vs created?
  - Time estimates vs actual?
  - Productivity trends?
- **Action Item:** Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for personal productivity

#### Visual Design Notes
- **Module logo colors** - Need to bring color back to module logos for better visual hierarchy and brand identity
- Consider using brand gradient colors from guidelines

### Strategic Considerations
- **Primary users:** FieldWorks employees company-wide
- **Backend:** Microsoft Planner (no data migration needed)
- **Authentication:** Azure AD/Entra (SSO with existing work accounts)
- **Deployment:** Azure Static Web App (already configured)
- **Integration focus:** Slack (company uses Slack, not Teams)

### Technical Considerations
- Manager interface leverages existing Graph API permissions
- All permissions already granted - ready to implement additional features
- ETag-based concurrency control implemented for Planner updates
- OrderHint system properly implemented for checklist sorting
- Consider rate limiting for bulk operations in future enhancements

#### Slack Integration Architecture
- **Data Storage:** ✅ Azure Table Storage implemented (SlackUserMappings, NotificationPreferences, TaskCheckTracking, MilestoneTracking, SlackMessageTaskLinks)
- **Backend Services:** ✅ Polling-based task monitoring, scheduled timer functions for digests and checks
- **Slack OAuth:** ✅ Implemented - User connects Slack account, encrypted token storage (AES-256-CBC)
- **ngrok Integration:** ✅ Permanent reserved domain (taskcommand.ngrok.app) for stable OAuth callbacks
- **Notification Architecture:** ✅ Polling-based (Microsoft Graph does not support webhooks for Planner tasks)
  - Assignment check: Timer function runs every 10 minutes, tracks last check time per user
  - Morning digest: Timer function runs daily at 8 AM
  - Services: taskPollingService.js, morningDigestService.js, slackService.js, slackFormatter.js
- **Scheduled Jobs:**
  - ✅ CheckTaskAssignments (every 10 min) - Poll for new task assignments
  - ✅ SendMorningDigest (daily 8 AM) - Send morning digest to opted-in users
  - ⏳ Daily kudos (5 PM) - Pending
  - ⏳ Weekly summary (Friday 4 PM) - Pending
- **Rate Limiting:** Handle Slack API and Microsoft Graph API rate limits (100ms delay between batch sends)
- **Timezone Support:** ⏳ Pending - Need to implement user timezone preferences for digest timing
- **Local Development:** ⚠️ Azure CDN outage workaround - extensionBundle commented out in host.json (restore before production deploy)

### Future Considerations
- Could be commercialized for other companies using Planner
- Build as internal tool first, prove value, then decide on external offering
- Potential to become standard at other organizations
- Keep architecture clean for potential multi-tenant future
