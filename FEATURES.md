## üìù Notes

### Strategic Considerations
- **Primary users:** FieldWorks employees company-wide
- **Backend:** Microsoft Planner (no data migration needed)
- **Authentication:** Azure AD/Entra (SSO with existing work accounts)
- **Deployment:** Azure Static Web App (already configured)
- **Integration focus:** Slack (company uses Slack, not Teams)

### Technical Considerations
- Manager interface leverages existing Graph API permissions
- All permissions already granted - ready to implement additional features
- ETag-based concurrency control implemented for Planner updates
- OrderHint system properly implemented for checklist sorting
- Consider rate limiting for bulk operations in future enhancements

#### Slack Integration Architecture
- **Data Storage:** Need to add SlackUserMappings, NotificationPreferences, and MilestoneTracking tables
- **Backend Services:** Slack webhook handlers, scheduled jobs for digests, notification queue
- **Slack OAuth:** User connects Slack account, store encrypted tokens
- **Scheduled Jobs:** Morning digest (8 AM), daily kudos (5 PM), weekly summary (Friday 4 PM)
- **Rate Limiting:** Handle Slack API and Microsoft Graph API rate limits
- **Timezone Support:** Respect user timezones for digest timing and quiet hours

### Future Considerations
- Could be commercialized for other companies using Planner
- Build as internal tool first, prove value, then decide on external offering
- Potential to become standard at other organizations
- Keep architecture clean for potential multi-tenant future
