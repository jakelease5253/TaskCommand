## üìù Notes

### Strategic Considerations
- **Primary users:** FieldWorks employees company-wide
- **Backend:** Microsoft Planner (no data migration needed)
- **Authentication:** Azure AD/Entra (SSO with existing work accounts)
- **Deployment:** Azure Static Web App (already configured)
- **Integration focus:** Slack (company uses Slack, not Teams)

### Technical Considerations
- Focus mode checklist features are top priority for immediate implementation
- Manager interface will leverage existing Graph API permissions
- All permissions already granted - ready to implement features
- ETag-based concurrency control required for Planner updates
- Consider rate limiting for bulk operations

### Future Considerations
- Could be commercialized for other companies using Planner
- Build as internal tool first, prove value, then decide on external offering
- Potential to become standard at other organizations
- Keep architecture clean for potential multi-tenant future
